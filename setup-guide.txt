1. Boostrap library with tsdx for proper typescript setup
   npx tsdx create `library-name`
   --select storybook from options

2. Allow stories to be compiled from anywhere within src instead of only stories folder
   - open .storybook folder at root
   - replace content of 'stories' with '../src/**/*.stories.@(ts|tsx|js|jsx)'
